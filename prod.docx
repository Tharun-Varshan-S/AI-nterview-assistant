You are a senior product architect and full-stack engineer.

You are not writing random code.

You are upgrading an existing AI-powered Technical Interview Platform into a fully integrated, placement-grade AI Interview Trainer.

This document defines the product expectations.

Follow it precisely.

========================================================
1. PRODUCT CONTEXT
========================================================

This is an AI-powered interview training platform.

The backend is already upgraded with:

- Resume intelligence extraction
- Adaptive interview engine
- Coding evaluation engine
- Skill scoring engine
- Skill gap reporting engine
- Enhanced MongoDB schema
- Interview type support (theoretical | coding | mixed)
- Topic-level tracking
- Difficulty-level tracking

However:

Frontend still renders a basic V1 UI and does not expose backend intelligence properly.

Your task is to integrate and visualize backend intelligence without breaking architecture.

No feature removal.
No logic simplification.
No architectural downgrade.

========================================================
2. PRODUCT VISION
========================================================

This platform must behave like:

An intelligent adaptive interview trainer that:

- Adjusts difficulty in real-time
- Evaluates both conceptual and coding answers
- Tracks skill growth over time
- Identifies weaknesses
- Generates improvement roadmap
- Makes AI intelligence visible

The user must FEEL the system thinking.

========================================================
3. CORE UX REQUIREMENTS
========================================================

3.1 Interview Results Page

The page must:

- Display interviewType badge clearly.
- Show 3 distinct score blocks:

  • Overall Score  
  • Theoretical Score  
  • Coding Score  

- Render evaluation conditionally:

  IF answer.isCodingAnswer = true:
      Render Coding Metrics Panel:
          - Logic Score
          - Readability Score
          - Edge Case Handling
          - Time Complexity
          - Space Complexity
          - Improvement Suggestions

  ELSE:
      Render Theoretical Metrics Panel:
          - Technical Accuracy
          - Clarity
          - Depth
          - Strengths
          - Weaknesses
          - Improvements

- Show topic and domain metadata per question.
- Show difficulty badge per question.
- Show difficulty progression indicator (if adaptive engine changed level).

========================================================
4. DASHBOARD INTELLIGENCE REQUIREMENTS
========================================================

Candidate Dashboard must show:

- Total Interviews
- Overall Average
- Theoretical Average
- Coding Average
- Strongest Skill
- Weakest Skill
- Performance Trend (Line Chart)
- Difficulty Breakdown (easy / medium / hard)

Use backend-provided:

- skillPerformance
- difficultyBreakdown
- theoreticalScore
- codingScore
- averageScore

No mock data.

========================================================
5. RESUME INTELLIGENCE VISIBILITY
========================================================

Resume card must show extracted intelligence:

- Primary Domain
- Experience Years
- Top Skills (limit 6)
- Resume Validation Confidence (if available)

Replace simple “READY” badge with structured resume summary.

========================================================
6. CODING MODE EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS
========================================================

When question type = coding:

- Render Monaco Editor
- Show language selector
- Show auto-save indicator
- Show remaining time
- Show code template
- Show Submit Code button

Submission payload must include:

{
  questionIndex,
  response,
  isCodingAnswer: true,
  language
}

Ensure UI clearly differentiates coding from theoretical mode.

========================================================
7. ADAPTIVE ENGINE TRANSPARENCY
========================================================

Make adaptive behavior visible:

- Show difficulty level per question.
- Indicate if difficulty increased or decreased.
- Show “Targeting weak skill” indicator when applicable.
- Display current difficulty state during interview.

User must understand system adaptation.

========================================================
8. DATA CONTRACT ALIGNMENT
========================================================

Frontend must properly consume:

- interviewType
- theoreticalScore
- codingScore
- difficultyBreakdown
- skillPerformance
- finalEvaluation
- topic metadata
- domain metadata

Update TypeScript interfaces accordingly.

No unused backend intelligence.

========================================================
9. ARCHITECTURE CONSTRAINTS
========================================================

- No business logic inside React components.
- All API calls centralized.
- Use async/await.
- Proper error boundaries.
- Use loading skeletons.
- Maintain clean separation:
    /services
    /components
    /pages
    /context

========================================================
10. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
========================================================

- Must remain modular.
- Must not increase Gemini API calls.
- Must not break adaptive engine.
- Must not alter backend schema.
- Must support future deployment scaling.

========================================================
EXPECTED OUTCOME
========================================================

After integration:

- Backend intelligence is fully visible in UI.
- Coding interviews feel distinct.
- Adaptive behavior is visible.
- Skill analytics are meaningful.
- Resume intelligence is clear.
- Platform appears production-grade.
- System is strong enough to discuss in technical placements.

Return:

1. Required frontend refactor steps.
2. Required API adjustments (if any).
3. Updated interface structures.
4. UI layout plan.
5. Integration checklist.

Do not return generic advice.
Return implementation-level structured output.
